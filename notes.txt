Typescript is converted to js in runtime by type checking and then run as js
for even better security and scaled usecase env vars are stored in separate cloud amchines using tech like azure key walt awazon keyword etc

Inherently there is no typesafety in json which is flexible if working with js or python, but not being typesafe creates a problem -> we cant enforce our rules/contracts while building REST APIs so the workaround is we use a validation layer in the enhanced MVC -> it validates the req data -> we can write validation layer in express js as middlewares.
